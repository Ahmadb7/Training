# Install Vagrant on Linux
## Install dep file (package manager is not recommended)
- Create a folder for your Vagrant project: `mkdir myvagrant`
- Then download the deb file and install it, for example for version 2.0.2:
```
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.0.2/vagrant_2.0.2_x86_64.deb
sudo dpkg -i vagrant_2.0.2_x86_64.deb
```
